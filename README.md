 "Drink Safe Amount of Caffeine" – A Power BI Report

 In this project, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to help users make informed choices about their daily caffeine intake. 
 The dataset includes caffeine content information from five popular coffee shop brands: Costa, Greggs, Pret, Caffè Nero, and Starbucks. 
 The focus is on three common coffee drinks: Single-shot Espresso, Cappuccino, and Filter/Brewed Coffee.
 The core objective of the report is to identify which coffee brand offers these drinks within a safe daily caffeine limit.

To make the report user-friendly, I included two interactive filters:

Drink Selector – Allows the user to choose one of the three drink types.

Number of Drinks per Day – Lets the user specify how many cups they consume daily.

Based on the user's selection, a bar chart dynamically updates to show the total caffeine intake from each brand. 
Each bar represents the total caffeine consumed per day for the selected drink and quantity, brand-wise.

To clearly indicate safe and unsafe levels of caffeine:

Bars turn red if the caffeine intake exceeds 400 milligrams, which is the generally recommended daily limit for most adults.

Bars remain gray if the caffeine level is within the safe limit.

This visual cue instantly helps users identify which brands offer safer caffeine levels for their preferred drink and daily consumption habits.
Through this project, I aimed to combine data storytelling with health-conscious decision-making, offering a practical and engaging way to analyze everyday choices using Power BI.
